## Indexing 
It is used to reduce the time of table scan in a Database. if the database is large Having an Index will reduce the time drastically
when we create a primary key while creating the table, It automatically acts as an Index by default.
we can also exclusively create an index for a column using the word "index" while creating the table. 
we can also assign an index to a preexisting tables column too. Indexing is similar to indexes in a book. It helps in identifying the required data(row Address) easily without the need of scanning the entire table.


for example 
1) by default 
create table table1
(column 1  int NOT NUll primary key,
column 2 varchar(20))
where column 1 by default becomes an index as it is the primary key for the table

2) exclusive Manual index entry
create table table 2
(column 1 int not null Primary Key,
column 2 varchar (20),
column 3 int,
column 4 int,
index column 3 (column 2,column 4)
)
where column 1(by default) and column 3 by "index" becomes the index to table 2

3)creating index after creating the table
create table table 3
(column 1 int not null Primary Key,
column 2 varchar (20),
column 3 int,
column 4 int)
create index ix_table3_column3
on table 3 (column3 ASC)

to find the indexes present in a table we can use the store proceedure
sp_helpIndex table_name
this will list the indexes present in the entered table 

we can also drop the index that we have created using drop
drop index tablename.indexname

we can also create index manuals through uX
by clicking the index ->new index->enter the anme of the index and type(clustred or non clustered, unique or non unique)
