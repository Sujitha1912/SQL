#SQL Interview Questions with examples:
### Order of execution:
f w g h s o l
f- from 
w- where
g-group by
h-having 
s-select
o-order by
l-limit

### 1) what is the difference between having and where clause?
They are both used for filtering, "where" is used to filter individual rows in a table on basis of a given condition, whereas "having" is used to filter groups, 
so normally "having" clause will have a group by with an aggregate function. 
Example:

Where :
select column1,column2 
from table 1
where [logical condition]

having:
select column 1, column 2 
from table 1 
group by column 1
having [condition]
order by column 2
