#SQL Interview Questions with examples:
### Order of execution: (logical processing order in a SQL query)
f w g h s o l
f- from 
w- where
g-group by
h-having 
s-select
o-order by
l-limit

### 1) what is the difference between having and where clause?
They are both used for filtering, "where" is used to filter individual rows in a table on basis of a given condition, whereas "having" is used to filter groups, 
so normally "having" clause will have a group by with an aggregate function. 
Example:

Where :
select column1,column2 
from table 1
where [logical condition]

having:
select column 1, column 2 
from table 1 
group by column 1
having [condition]
order by column 2

## 2)indexing: 
indexing in SQL is similar to a book index. indexing reduces the table scan time. before indexing the data in the database is just a heap of data.
indexing is used to properly ordeva data. 
one of the indexing is through assigning a primary key to the table. primary key are the keys that are not null and unique to the table. 
we can also creat indexing by making any column a unique column. 
this man made unique keys can have null values. this can be dobe by using the constraints unique.
when we speak about indexing.there are two main types pf it. 
its clustered and non clustered.
